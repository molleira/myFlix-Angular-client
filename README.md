## myFlix Angular Client

![Demo](demo/demo.gif)

This project is a single-page, responsive movie app built using **Angular** and **TypeScript**, with routing and several interface views. The client-side supports the existing server-side (REST API and database) by facilitating user requests and rendering the response. It was designed using **Angular Material** and contains comments using **Typedoc** and technical documentation using **JSDoc**.

### About
Angular is an extremely popular framework that can be used for a wide range of mobile and desktop applications. It's particularly well-suited to large projects, as well as projects requiring a complex user interface because it comes with a variety of built-in modules and services.

For this project I used *Agile* project management techniques including *user stories*, *story points*, and a *kanban board*. At the same time, I practiced communicating the skills and knowledge that I acquired with technical interview questions before finalizing the project.

### Features
* Displays a welcome screen where users can log in or register for a new account.
* Users are authenticated, then they can view all movies.
* In the main view showing all movies, users can click on buttons to view:
  * a description about the movie.
  * the genre of the movie and details about the genre.
  * the director of the movie and details about the director.
* In this main view, users can add and remove movies from their list of favorites.
* Users can also view their profile where they can see their favorite movies, remove movies from their favorites, and edit their profile details.

### Development
To run this project on a development server, run the following command, then navigate to the localhost port stated in your terminal.
```
ng serve
```

In the future I intend improve the UI to make it even more attractive and easy to use. Before that, I plan to add much more movies data to the database in order to create a more exhaustive movies platform.

### Usage
Please let me know if you would like to use this project as a template to create your own. I'll be happy to get in touch and help with whatever you need.
